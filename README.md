# Unity Game Project
This is a project that I created in early 2017 for a quarterly project. 

## Project Idea
The premise for the game is that you play as a sentient Android trying to escape from your creator. The main gameplay mechanic is that you would need to keep collecting power from other objects in order to use your abilities. I planned to eventually incorporate that into puzzles (e.g. draining power from a security gate to open it).

## What I Got Working
This project had a fully animated robot creature that was capable of moving in all four directions (using W-A-S-D) and had the ability to slide and crouch. 

I made an early prototype for the power draining mechanic as well, but it still has work to be done on it. 

## Future development
I stopped working on this project in 2017 and at this time, I have no plans to continue working on it.
